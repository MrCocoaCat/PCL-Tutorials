An octree is a tree-based data structure for managing sparse 3-D data. Each internal node has exactly eight children. In this tutorial we will learn how to use the octree for spatial partitioning and neighbor search within pointcloud data. Particularly, we explain how to perform a “Neighbors within Voxel Search”, the “K Nearest Neighbor Search” and “Neighbors within Radius Search”.
octree 是一种用于管理稀疏3D数据的树状数据结构，每个结点都有8个子节点。本节介绍如何使用octree在点云数据中进行空间划分及近邻搜索
