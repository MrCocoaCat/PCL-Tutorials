In this tutorial we will learn how to use an ExtractIndices filter to extract a subset of points from a point cloud based on the indices output by a segmentation algorithm. In order to not complicate the tutorial, the segmentation algorithm is not explained here. Please check the Plane model segmentation tutorial for more information.
