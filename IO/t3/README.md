In this tutorial we will learn how to concatenating the points of two different point clouds. The constraint imposed here is that the type and number of fields in the two datasets has to be equal. We will also learn how to concatenate the fields (e.g., dimensions) of two different point clouds. The constraint imposed here is that the number of points in the two datasets has to be equal.
