This document demonstrates how to remove outliers from a PointCloud using several different methods in the filter module. First we will look at how to use a ConditionalRemoval filter which removes all indices in the given input cloud that do not satisfy one or more given conditions. Then we will learn how to us a RadiusOutlierRemoval filter which removes all indices in it’s input cloud that don’t have at least some number of neighbors within a certain range.
